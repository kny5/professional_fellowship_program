I was in a financial bind, wondering how to make ends meet. Little did I know that this moment would shape my journey. I faced a tough decision: pay the electricity bill or invest my last pesos in a ticket to Startup Weekend 2013 in Tuxtla Gutierrez. It was a reckless choice, but a gut feeling urged me on.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">To my surprise, I not only attended but also won the first prize, alongside a team I barely knew. It was a rollercoaster of success and subsequent challenges, but that experience ignited my entrepreneurial spirit. It drove me to explore various non-traditional learning avenues, from scouring open internet resources to participating in incubation programs at MIT.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Hailing from Chiapas, the poorest state in Mexico by income per capita, and where resources are scarce, I've learned a valuable lesson: self-reliance. When you can't find a decent job, you have to create your own source of income.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Presently, I’m part of the Professional Fellowship Program at the U.S. Department of State, living just 30 meters from Robert Frost’s house in Amherst, MA – how cool is that! The fellowship is nourishing my mind, exposing me to different discussions about the U.S. Constitution, democracy, the free market, the importance of circular immigration and human rights, and the understanding of leadership as a process.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Last week, I attended a board meeting where people were deciding where to allocate $100 million to stimulate jobs and the economy in an entire region. We had scholars from UMASS, Amherst College, Columbia University, and I took the initiative to reach out to the MIT American Natives Science and Engineering Society, where I had the chance to interview Professor Jean-Luc Pierite.</span></p><figure class="post__image post__image--full"><figure class="post__image post__image--wide"><img loading="lazy" src="./media/posts/7//20230914_132924.jpg" alt="" width="1000" height="451" sizes="100vw" srcset="./media/posts/7//responsive/20230914_132924-xs.jpg 300w, ./media/posts/7//responsive/20230914_132924-sm.jpg 480w, ./media/posts/7//responsive/20230914_132924-md.jpg 768w, ./media/posts/7//responsive/20230914_132924-lg.jpg 1024w, ./media/posts/7//responsive/20230914_132924-xl.jpg 1360w, ./media/posts/7//responsive/20230914_132924-2xl.jpg 1600w"></figure><figcaption>Antonio Anaya visiting MIT Center for Bits and Atoms.

Of course, we not only work relentlessly on our projects and deliverables but also had the chance to visit New York City, walking 50 kilometers in the rain, getting our shoes soaked, and catching the flu. Lovely. We have also had the opportunity to talk to everyday people and understand the many cultural mixings happening in the U.S.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">Looking ahead, effecting change requires a mix of technical, interpersonal, and financial skills, which is a challenge for me as I transition from a technical background to the decision-making front. After I return home, there's an action plan to implement over the next three months and a mini-grant to secure. There is still much to learn about which parameters are more important for a successful project assessment, but I make progress every day by talking to my host, Tricia at Tech Foundry, reading articles, and watching crash course videos.</span></p><p><span style="font-weight: 400;">The takeaway: Often, you'll be the first or the only one doing it, and your ideas may not always be met with enthusiasm. Change and uniqueness can be unsettling for many. But if you want to make a difference in the world around you, you've got to take that leap.</span></p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on September 29, 2023</p><div class="post__share"><a href="https://www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Flooking-at-leadership-and-development-with-brand-new-eyes.html" class="js-share facebook" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#facebook"/></svg> <span>Facebook</span> </a><a href="https://www.linkedin.com/sharing/share-offsite/?url=%23PUBLII_RELATIVE_URL_BASE%23%2Flooking-at-leadership-and-development-with-brand-new-eyes.html" class="js-share linkedin" rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer"><svg class="icon" aria-hidden="true" focusable="false"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#linkedin"/></svg> <span>LinkedIn</span></a></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="./authors/antonio-anaya/" rel="author">Antonio Anaya</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="./one-pager-template.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> One pager action plan</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="./introduction.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Introduction </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2023-09-26T17:01" class="feed__date">September 26, 2023</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="./distributed-manufacturing-network-for-economic-development-of-central-america.html">A Distributed Manufacturing Network for economic development</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Author: Antonio de Jesus Anaya Hernandez<br><br>License: Attribution-NonCommercial-NoDerivatives 4.0 International (CC BY-NC-ND 4.0) </p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="./assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script defer="defer" src="./assets/js/scripts.min.js?v=f47c11534595205f20935f0db2a62a85"></script><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig={mobileMenuMode:'sidebar',animationSpeed:300,submenuWidth: 'auto',doubleClickTime:500,mobileMenuExpandableSubmenus:true,relatedContainerForOverlayMenuSelector:'.top'};</script><script>var images = document.querySelectorAll('img[loading]');
